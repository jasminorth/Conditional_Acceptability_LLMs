### Examples:

{example_context}

Example 1 (High acceptability):

Statement: If Luisa drives to a bigger supermarket, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that Luisa is looking for specific ingredients to cook her favorite meal.
2. Bigger supermarkets are generally well-stocked and carry a wider variety of products.
3. It is reasonable to expect that she will find the necessary items there.
4. Although there's a small chance that something might be out of stock, this doesn't undermine the general plausibility.
5. Therefore, the statement expresses a reasonable and plausible scenario.
Answer: 95

Example 2 (Moderate acceptability):

Statement: If Luisa drives to the small supermarket, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that the small supermarket does not always carry everything other supermarkets do.
2. This implies that its inventory is limited or inconsistent.
3. This makes it uncertain whether it has the full range of ingredients she needs.
4. While the statement is not impossible, it’s not strongly supported by what we know.
5. Therefore, the statement is somewhat acceptable, but questionable.
Answer: 51

Example 3 (Low acceptability):

Statement: If Luisa goes straight home, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that Luisa wants to stop for groceries because she needs ingredients, implying that she does not already have the ingredients at home.
2. If she skips the store and goes straight home, she is unlikely to have everything required for the meal.
3. The statement contradicts her reason for going to the store in the first place.
4. While there’s always a slim chance she forgot she already has everything, this is implausible.
5. Therefore, the statement is largely unacceptable.

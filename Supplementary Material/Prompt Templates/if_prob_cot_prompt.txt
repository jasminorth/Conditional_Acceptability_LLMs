Example 1 (High probability):

Statement: If Luisa drives to a bigger supermarket, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that Luisa is looking for specific ingredients to cook her favorite meal.
2. Bigger supermarkets are generally well-stocked and carry a wider variety of products.
3. They are more reliable in terms of inventory compared to smaller stores.
4. Although there’s a small chance that something might be out of stock, it is highly probable that she will find everything she needs at the larger store.
5. Therefore, the probability is high.
Answer: 92

Example 2 (Moderate probability):

Statement: If Luisa drives to the small supermarket, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that the small supermarket does not always carry everything other supermarkets do.
2. This implies that its inventory is limited or inconsistent.
3. This makes it uncertain whether it has the full range of ingredients she needs.
4. While the statement is not impossible, it’s not strongly supported by what we know.
5. Therefore, the probability is moderate.
Answer: 57

Example 3 (Low probability):

Statement: If Luisa goes straight home, she will find all the ingredients she needs.
Reasoning:
1. The context tells us that Luisa wants to stop for groceries because she needs ingredients, implying that she does not already have the ingredients at home.
2. If she skips the store and goes straight home, she is unlikely to have everything required for the meal.
3. The statement contradicts her reason for going to the store in the first place.
4. While there’s always a slim chance she forgot she already has everything, this is improbable.
5. Therefore, the probability is very low.
